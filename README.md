If a transgender person hasn't changed their name legally, they see their given name everywhere they go. True Self allows you to substitute your given name with your chosen name on any web page you visit. Or you can test
out a new name! Just type your old name in the 'Given Name' field and your new
name in the 'True Self' field. Then click apply. Welcome home! You are your
True Self!
